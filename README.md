# Mellow TS
A command line lookalike, in your web-browser; my submission for CodeFest Î±.

## Instructions

You can view the project without any setup at [`terminal.skrub.dev`](https://terminal.skrub.dev) or, if you want to, build it.

## Build Instructions

First make sure you have NodeJS, NPM, and Webpack.

Next, `git clone` this repo and navigate to it in your terminal of choice.

Run `npm i` then `npm run build`, the bundled file should be in the `/dist` folder.

You can now open `src/index.html`.

## In Terminal

You can use `help` for a list of commands and hit Enter.


## Thanks To:

- Webpack
- Typescript
- Wttr.in
